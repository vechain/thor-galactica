# Galactica VIPs

Galactica VIPs introduce key foundational upgrades to the protocol. From the Dynamic Gas Fee Market and changes in the VTHO transaction model, to an EVM upgrade that introduces enhanced compatibility with common tools - Galactica VIPs ignite our evolution - and your vote gets us there!

## VIP-251: Dynamic Fee Market

This upgrade introduces a dynamic fee market for transactions, inspired by Ethereum EIP-1559. 

It replaces the fixed-fee model with two components: a base fee that adjusts with network demand, and an optional priority fee that users can use to incentivize validators for faster processing.

Additionally, under VIP-251, 100% of base fees are burned, accelerating VTHO's path to deflation, increasing overall gas consumption, and optimizing network performance. The VIP reduces attack vectors by making spam prohibitively expensive, and delivers sustainable, long-term value for the protocol through adoption and usage.

## VIP-252: Typed Transactions

This VIP introduces a standardized transaction envelope format that revolutionizes how VeChainThor processes blockchain operations, identifying and managing different types of blockchain transactions and making contract interactions easier.

This modular approach allows VeChainThor to integrate new features smoothly and continuously, letting the protocol evolve without disrupting network operations or fragmenting the ecosystem. These are important foundations for the future.

## VIP-242: Paris > Shanghai EVM Upgrade

Aligning with Ethereum's Shanghai release, this proposal brings VeChainThor up to date with recent Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) advancements.

The synchronization with industry standards creates a more seamless pathway for developers to bring their tools and applications to VeChainThor. By matching Ethereum's EVM capabilities, we're unlocking new opportunities for cross-chain innovation and deeper blockchain integration. The upgrade introduces PUSH0, and optimises gas costs.

The focus on industry standards also extends to JSON RPC support â€“ a technical goal of VeChain Renaissance (not included in Galactica). The protocol stands to be a fundamental addition to our compatibility toolkit, enabling direct integration with Ethereum-native tools and wallets, and opening the door to ecosystem expansion at an entirely new scale.

## VIP-250: Extension Contract v2 > v3

The Extension Contract is one for the devs, introducing new functions for retrieving total clauses, as well as the current clause index in transactions. In a nutshell, it saves developer time and simplifies contract execution.

*We would like to thank community Developer, [DataB4Dishonor](https://x.com/DataB4Dishonor), for raising this topic, ultimately contributing to its inclusion as a Galactica VIP.*
